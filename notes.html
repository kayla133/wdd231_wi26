<!-- In Class Notes on JSON 
 A way of transfering information across the internet.
 XML was the way they used to accomplish this until JSON came around.
 XML is a markup language that resembles HTML. It uses the same type of tags to define content.

 JSON does not allow comments or methods.
 Must use double quotes.
 A very picky language.
